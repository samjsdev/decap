Whitening is most effective when the treatment is customized to your enamel shade, sensitivity profile, and daily habits.

## Why in-clinic plans look different

In-clinic systems use controlled concentrations and isolation protocols that protect soft tissue while delivering even lightening.

## The role of maintenance

Coffee, tea, and tobacco can re-stain enamel over time. Maintenance trays or periodic in-office boosts keep shade drift under control.

## When whitening is not enough

Intrinsic discoloration or old restorations may need veneers or bonding for true color harmony.
