Dental emergencies are stressful, but immediate action often improves outcomes.

## Toothache with swelling

Use a cold compress and avoid heat. Contact the clinic immediately so we can evaluate for infection and provide rapid pain control.

## Chipped or broken tooth

Rinse gently and save any fragments in clean saline or milk. Avoid chewing on that side until a dentist evaluates the fracture depth.

## Knocked-out tooth

Hold the tooth by the crown, not the root. If possible, place it back in the socket or store it in milk and seek care urgently.
