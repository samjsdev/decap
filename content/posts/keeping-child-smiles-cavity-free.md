School schedules can quickly disrupt oral care routines. A cavity-prevention strategy works best when it is simple enough to repeat every day.

## Build a predictable brushing rhythm

Aim for two full brushing sessions each day and make the evening routine non-negotiable. Night brushing matters most because saliva flow drops while sleeping.

## Rethink snack frequency

Frequent snacking exposes enamel to repeated acid attacks. Pair snacks with water and keep grazing windows short to reduce risk.

## Keep cleanings on a fixed calendar

Regular preventive visits help us catch early enamel changes before they become fillings.
