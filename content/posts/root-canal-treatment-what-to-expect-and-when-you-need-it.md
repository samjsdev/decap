### What is Root Canal Treatment?

Root canal treatment is a dental procedure used to save a tooth that is badly decayed or infected. Instead of removing the tooth, the infected pulp inside the tooth is cleaned, disinfected, and sealed to prevent further infection.

This treatment helps relieve pain and allows you to keep your natural tooth.

### When Do You Need a Root Canal?

You may need a root canal if you experience:

- Severe tooth pain while chewing
- Sensitivity to hot or cold that lasts for a long time
- Swollen or tender gums
- Darkening of the tooth
- Repeated gum abscess near the tooth

Early treatment can prevent complications and tooth loss.

### Is Root Canal Treatment Painful?

A common myth is that root canal treatment is painful.  
With modern techniques and local anesthesia, the procedure is **mostly painless** and similar to getting a dental filling.

Most patients feel relief from pain after the infection is removed.

### How Is the Procedure Done?

1. The dentist numbs the tooth and surrounding area  
2. Infected pulp is carefully removed  
3. The root canals are cleaned and disinfected  
4. The tooth is sealed and restored with a filling or crown  

The procedure usually takes one or two visits.

### Recovery After Root Canal Treatment

- Mild soreness for a few days is normal  
- Avoid chewing hard foods on the treated tooth initially  
- Maintain good oral hygiene  
- Attend follow-up visits if advised  

Most patients return to normal activities the same day.
